## 13. WORKFLOW TIPS

1. **Always connect first** before querying data
2. **Start with discovery** - run `What tables are in my database?`
3. **Use natural language** - Claude will translate to correct tool calls
4. **Include table names** - Be specific about which table you're querying
5. **Test with simple queries** before complex filters
6. **Use OData syntax** for precise filtering when needed

---

## 14. COMMON PATTERNS

### Pattern: Explore → Query → Create
```
1. "What tables are in my database?"
2. "Show me the first 5 records from Contacts"
3. "Create a new contact with FirstName 'Jane', LastName 'Smith'"
```

### Pattern: Filter → Count → Export
```
1. "Find all contacts where City eq 'Boston'"
2. "Count how many contacts have City eq 'Boston'"
3. "Get all Boston contacts with only Name and Email fields"
```

### Pattern: Find → Update → Verify
```
1. "Get record '12345' from Contacts"
2. "Update record '12345', set Email to 'new@email.com'"
3. "Get record '12345' from Contacts"
```

## 15. TESTING WITH POSTMAN

Before using with Claude Desktop, you can test your FileMaker OData connection with Postman:

### URL Structure
```
{server}/fmi/odata/v4/{database-name}
```

### Example URLs to Test

**1. Service Document (List all tables)**
```
GET http://192.168.0.24/fmi/odata/v4/Contacts
```

**2. Metadata (Database schema)**
```
GET http://your-server/fmi/odata/v4/Contacts/$metadata
```

**3. Query a Table**
```
GET http://192.168.0.24/fmi/odata/v4/Contacts/YourTableName
```

**4. Count Records**
```
GET http://your-server/fmi/odata/v4/Contacts/YourTableName/$count
```

### Postman Setup

1. **Method**: GET
2. **URL**: Use one of the URLs above
3. **Authorization**: 
   - Type: Basic Auth
   - Username: Your FileMaker username
   - Password: Your FileMaker password
4. **Headers**: 
   - `Accept: application/json` (optional, OData defaults to JSON)

### Example: Testing Service Document

1. Open Postman
2. Create new GET request
3. URL: `http://your-server/fmi/odata/v4/your-database`
4. Go to Authorization tab → Select "Basic Auth"
5. Enter your FileMaker username and password
6. Click "Send"

**Expected Response**: JSON showing all available tables/entity sets

### Example: Testing a Table Query

1. URL: `http://your-server/fmi/odata/v4/your-database/contacts?$top=5`
2. Authorization: Basic Auth with credentials
3. Click "Send"

**Expected Response**: JSON array with first 5 records from contacts table

### Common Postman Test URLs

```
# Service document
http://your-server/fmi/odata/v4/your-database

# Metadata XML
http://your-server/fmi/odata/v4/your-database/$metadata

# First 10 records from a table
http://your-server/fmi/odata/v4/your-database/TableName?$top=10

# Filtered query
http://your-server/fmi/odata/v4/your-database/TableName?$filter=Status eq 'Active'

# Count records
http://your-server/fmi/odata/v4/your-database/TableName/$count
```

### Troubleshooting Postman Tests

- **401 Unauthorized**: Check username/password
- **404 Not Found**: Verify server URL and database name (case-sensitive)
- **Connection Error**: Ensure FileMaker Server is accessible from your network
- **SSL Certificate Error**: 
  - For local/development: Use `http://` instead of `https://`
  - For self-signed certificates: Disable SSL verification (see SSL Configuration below)
  - For production: Use valid SSL certificates

### SSL Configuration

The MCP server includes SSL verification control:

**Via Environment Variable:**
```bash
FM_VERIFY_SSL=false  # Disable SSL verification (not recommended for production)
FM_VERIFY_SSL=true   # Enable SSL verification (default, recommended)
```

**Via Config File (`~/.fms-odata-mcp/config.json`):**
```json
{
  "filemaker": {
    "verifySsl": false
  }
}
```

**Default Behavior:**
- SSL verification is **enabled by default** (secure)
- Only disable for local development or testing with self-signed certificates
- Never disable SSL verification in production environments

**When to Disable SSL Verification:**
- Testing with local FileMaker Server using self-signed certificates
- Development environments without proper SSL setup
- Internal networks with self-signed certificates

**Security Warning:** Disabling SSL verification makes connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Only use this option in trusted, isolated environments.

## 16. TROUBLESHOOTING

### Connection Issues
- Verify server URL includes protocol (http:// or https://)
- Check username and password
- Ensure database name is exact (case-sensitive)
- Test with: `What FileMaker connection am I using?`

### Query Issues
- Check table name spelling (use: `What tables are in my database?`)
- Verify field names in metadata
- Use correct OData syntax for filters
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
