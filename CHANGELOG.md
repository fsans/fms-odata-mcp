## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-01

Three new expression-builder tools for FileMaker Server 2025 OData capabilities.
All three are **connection-free** — they build query expressions locally and return
strings ready to pass into existing tools like `fm_odata_query_records`.
Total tool count increases from 19 to 22.

### Added

- **`fm_odata_aggregate`** — server-side aggregation via OData `$apply`
  (requires FileMaker Server v22.0.1+ / FileMaker 2025 or later).
  Accepts `table`, `method` (sum/average/min/max/countdistinct/count), `alias`,
  optional `field`, `groupBy` array, and `filter` pre-condition.
  Internally builds `groupby((…),aggregate(…))` / `filter(…)/…` expressions via
  `ODataParser.buildApplyExpression()` and executes a GET with `?$apply=…`.

- **`fm_odata_cast`** — server-side type coercion via OData property path segments
  (requires FileMaker Server v21.1+ / FileMaker 2024 or later).
  Accepts an array of `{field, type}` pairs and an optional `context`
  (`select` or `filter`). Returns `Field/Edm.Type` expressions ready for use in
  `$select` or embedded in `$filter`. No active connection required.
  Supported types: `String`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `Decimal`, `Double`, `Boolean`,
  `Date`, `TimeOfDay`, `DateTimeOffset`.

- **`fm_odata_build_filter`** — parameterized `$filter` builder via OData `@alias`
  syntax (requires FileMaker Server v21.1+ / FileMaker 2024 or later).
  Accepts a `template` string with `@alias` placeholders, a `params` map, and an
  optional `mode`:
  - `resolved` (default): substitutes alias values into the template and returns a
    plain filter string for immediate use in `fm_odata_query_records`.
  - `raw`: returns the OData parameterized query string form
    (`$filter=…&@alias=value`) for manual URL construction.
  String values are auto-quoted and internal single quotes doubled; numbers,
  booleans, and `null` are passed through as-is. No active connection required.

- **`ODataParser.buildApplyExpression()`** — static helper building `$apply`
  expressions from structured aggregation inputs.

- **`ODataParser.buildCastExpression()`** — static helper producing
  `Field/Edm.Type` path segments; normalises bare type names and `Edm.`-prefixed
  names to the same output.

- **`ODataParser.buildParameterizedFilter()`** — static helper for `@alias`
  substitution in filter templates; supports resolved and raw modes.

- **`ODataClient.aggregateRecords()`** — new method executing GET with `?$apply=`.

- **`AGENTS.md`** — project-level rules file for AI agents: no attribution footers
  in commits, documented FileMaker OData unsupported features (lambda `any`/`all`,
  `$search`, geo functions).

### Not implemented (FileMaker limitation)

- **Lambda operators `any` / `all`** — officially unsupported by FileMaker Server
  OData (listed in Claris `odata-unsupported-features.html`, current as of 2026).
  Will not be implemented until Claris adds support.

### Tests

- 22 new unit tests: `buildApplyExpression` (9), `buildCastExpression` (6),
  `buildParameterizedFilter` (10), plus 6 routing/behaviour tests for the new tools.
- Total: 121 tests across 5 suites (up from 90).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-25

Patch release on top of 0.3.0. Version bump and npm publish housekeeping.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 0.3.1 for npm release consistency

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-25

Major stability and correctness release. All changes since 0.2.8 are included here.
FileMaker 2025 advanced OData features (aggregation, type casting, parametrization)
were deferred from this release to keep it focused on reliability; they are
implemented in v0.4.0. Lambda operators (`any`/`all`) remain unsupported by
FileMaker Server OData and are not planned.

### Added

- **`fm_odata_test_connection_detailed`** — new tool that surfaces the real underlying
  error (network, SSL, auth) when a connection attempt fails, replacing opaque failures
  ([#8](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/8))
- **Docker localhost warning** — server prints a clear warning at startup when
  `MCP_HOST=localhost` is detected inside a container, guiding users to use `0.0.0.0`
  ([#10](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/10))

### Fixed

- **OData URL construction** — fixed FileMaker-incompatible URL building that caused
  query failures on certain table/filter combinations
  ([#2](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/pull/2))
- **OData response parser** — corrected response parsing bugs introduced by the above;
  regex metacharacters in table names are now properly escaped
  ([#11](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/11))
- **Tool routing** — tools are now dispatched by exact name-set lookup instead of
  fragile string-prefix matching, preventing mis-routing of similarly named tools
  ([#2](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/2))
- **JSON-RPC response correlation** — concurrent HTTP requests no longer receive each
  other's responses; responses are matched by request `id`
  ([#3](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/3))
- **CORS middleware ordering** — CORS headers are now registered before route handlers,
  fixing preflight (`OPTIONS`) request failures
  ([#6](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/6))
- **SIGTERM / graceful shutdown** — server now handles `SIGTERM` for clean Docker
  container stops; `dumb-init` no longer required to avoid zombie processes
  ([#20](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/20))
- **Failed inline connection cleanup** — a failed `fm_odata_connect` call no longer
  leaves a broken partial connection in state; the real error is reported
  ([#14](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/14))
- **`validateConfig` at startup** — configuration is now validated when the server
  starts, not lazily on first use; misconfigured environments fail fast with a clear
  message ([#15](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/15))
- **Centralised default ports** — default HTTP (3333) and HTTPS (3443) ports now live
  in a single shared constants file, eliminating drift between transport modules
  ([#12](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/12))
- **Runtime version** — server version is now read from `package.json` at runtime
  instead of being hardcoded, so it always matches the published package
  ([#9](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/9))

### Security

- **Password redaction in debug logs** — passwords are scrubbed from tool argument
  objects before they are written to debug output, preventing credential exposure in
  log files ([#22](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/22))

### Refactored

- **Config saved-file schema** — tightened validation schema for
  `~/.fms-odata-mcp/config.json`; added field trimming and a dedicated `verifySsl`
  helper to centralise SSL flag coercion
  ([#16](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/16),
  [#17](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/17),
  [#18](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/18))

### Tests

- Added unit tests for tool routing and config helpers; tightened mock typings
- Removed unused MCP schema imports from `tools/odata.ts`
- Removed unused `Express` import from `simple-http-transport.ts`
