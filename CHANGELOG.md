## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-02

Server version detection, feature compatibility matrix, and smart fallbacks.
Tool count increases from 25 to 26.

### Added

- **`fm_odata_get_server_version`** — detects FileMaker Server version from `$metadata`
  XML (cached per session, zero extra HTTP calls on subsequent uses). Returns structured
  JSON: `{ session, server, database, version, features }` where `features` is a
  compatibility map (`basic_odata`, `cast`, `build_filter`, `aggregate`).

- **`src/fm-version.ts`** — new module: `FMServerVersion` interface, `FM_FEATURE_MATRIX`,
  `parseServerVersion()`, `compareVersions()`, `isFeatureSupported()`,
  `featureWarning()`, `buildFeatureReport()`.

- **Version detection** reads the `Org.OData.Core.V1.ProductVersion` annotation in
  `$metadata` XML first; falls back to the `Version` attribute on `edmx:Edmx`; returns
  `null` if undetectable. Result is cached in `ODataClient._cachedVersion` for the
  session lifetime.

- **Feature compatibility matrix**:
  - `basic_odata` — FM 19.0.0+ (all supported servers)
  - `cast` — FM 21.1.0+ (FileMaker 2024)
  - `build_filter` — FM 21.1.0+ (FileMaker 2024)
  - `aggregate` — FM 22.0.1+ (FileMaker 2025)

### Changed

- **`fm_odata_aggregate`** — now version-gated: executes server-side `$apply` on
  FM 22.0.1+; falls back to client-side computation (sum/avg/min/max/count/countdistinct
  + groupBy) capped at 10 000 records on older or unknown servers. A `[Compatibility]`
  advisory notice is prepended to the result when the fallback is used.

- **`fm_odata_cast`** and **`fm_odata_build_filter`** — prepend an advisory notice
  when the server version is known-incompatible or undetectable. Expression is always
  returned; no hard errors.

- **`fm_odata_list_active_sessions`** — appends `| FM Server x.x.x` when version is
  already cached for a session (zero extra HTTP calls).

### Tests

- New: `tests/unit/fm-version.test.ts` — 55 tests covering version parsing (8 EDMX
  fixture variants), `compareVersions`, `isFeatureSupported` across all boundaries,
  `featureWarning`, `buildFeatureReport` for v19/v22/null, all 6 client-side aggregate
  methods, groupBy, server-side path, and `fm_odata_get_server_version` routing.
- Total: 191 tests across 7 suites (up from 146 across 6 suites).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **`fm_odata_connect_multi`** — bulk-connect N databases in one call.
  Accepts a shared `server`/`user`/`password` plus a `databases` array
  where each entry can override credentials and set an `alias` and `primary` flag.
  Connects and tests all sessions in parallel; sets the primary (or first
  successful) session as active. Designed for FileMaker separation-of-concerns
  solutions (LOGIC + DATA files) and multi-solution server setups.

- **`fm_odata_list_active_sessions`** — list all live in-memory sessions.
  Returns alias, server, database, user, and which session is currently active.
  Replaces guessing for AI agents working in multi-file environments.

- **`fm_odata_describe_sessions`** — merged schema across all active sessions.
  Calls `$metadata` on every session in parallel, returns a flat annotated table
  list `[{table, connection, fieldCount, fields[]}]`. Flags table name collisions
  across sessions and suggests using the `connection` param to disambiguate.

- **Per-call `connection` parameter** on all 11 connection-dependent OData tools
  (`fm_odata_get_service_document`, `fm_odata_get_metadata`, `fm_odata_list_tables`,
  `fm_odata_query_records`, `fm_odata_get_record`, `fm_odata_get_records`,
  `fm_odata_count_records`, `fm_odata_aggregate`, `fm_odata_create_record`,
  `fm_odata_update_record`, `fm_odata_delete_record`).
  Lets AI agents target a specific session per call without changing the active
  session pointer. Stateless tools (`fm_odata_cast`, `fm_odata_build_filter`)
  are unaffected.

- **`ConnectionManager.getClientByName()`** — side-effect-free session lookup
  by alias; does not mutate the active connection pointer.

- **`ConnectionManager.listActiveSessions()`** — returns `SessionInfo[]` for all
  in-memory sessions including `isCurrent` flag.

- **Explicit alias support** in `ConnectionManager.createInlineClientNamed()` —
  multi-connect sessions are registered under human-readable aliases rather than
  auto-generated `inline_…` keys.

### Changed

- **`fm_odata_set_connection`** — now accepts runtime session aliases (inline /
  multi-connect) in addition to persisted config names.

- **`ConnectionManager.setCurrentConnection()`** — checks in-memory session cache
  first, then falls back to persisted config, eliminating the need to re-register
  inline sessions.

### Fixed

- **`working-http-transport.ts` TypeScript strict-null error** — pre-existing
  `TS2345` ("undefined not assignable to string | number") in the pending-response
  map lookup; guarded with an explicit null check.

### Tests

- New: `tests/unit/multi-session.test.ts` — 30 tests covering ConnectionManager
  primitives, tool routing for all 3 new tools, per-call connection targeting,
  session switching, collision detection.
- Extended: `tests/unit/tool-routing.test.ts` — 3 new routing assertions.
- Total: 146 tests across 6 suites (up from 121 across 5 suites).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-01

Three new expression-builder tools for FileMaker Server 2025 OData capabilities.
All three are **connection-free** — they build query expressions locally and return
strings ready to pass into existing tools like `fm_odata_query_records`.
Total tool count increases from 19 to 22.

### Added

- **`fm_odata_aggregate`** — server-side aggregation via OData `$apply`
  (requires FileMaker Server v22.0.1+ / FileMaker 2025 or later).
  Accepts `table`, `method` (sum/average/min/max/countdistinct/count), `alias`,
  optional `field`, `groupBy` array, and `filter` pre-condition.
  Internally builds `groupby((…),aggregate(…))` / `filter(…)/…` expressions via
  `ODataParser.buildApplyExpression()` and executes a GET with `?$apply=…`.

- **`fm_odata_cast`** — server-side type coercion via OData property path segments
  (requires FileMaker Server v21.1+ / FileMaker 2024 or later).
  Accepts an array of `{field, type}` pairs and an optional `context`
  (`select` or `filter`). Returns `Field/Edm.Type` expressions ready for use in
  `$select` or embedded in `$filter`. No active connection required.
  Supported types: `String`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `Decimal`, `Double`, `Boolean`,
  `Date`, `TimeOfDay`, `DateTimeOffset`.

- **`fm_odata_build_filter`** — parameterized `$filter` builder via OData `@alias`
  syntax (requires FileMaker Server v21.1+ / FileMaker 2024 or later).
  Accepts a `template` string with `@alias` placeholders, a `params` map, and an
  optional `mode`:
  - `resolved` (default): substitutes alias values into the template and returns a
    plain filter string for immediate use in `fm_odata_query_records`.
  - `raw`: returns the OData parameterized query string form
    (`$filter=…&@alias=value`) for manual URL construction.
  String values are auto-quoted and internal single quotes doubled; numbers,
  booleans, and `null` are passed through as-is. No active connection required.

- **`ODataParser.buildApplyExpression()`** — static helper building `$apply`
  expressions from structured aggregation inputs.

- **`ODataParser.buildCastExpression()`** — static helper producing
  `Field/Edm.Type` path segments; normalises bare type names and `Edm.`-prefixed
  names to the same output.

- **`ODataParser.buildParameterizedFilter()`** — static helper for `@alias`
  substitution in filter templates; supports resolved and raw modes.

- **`ODataClient.aggregateRecords()`** — new method executing GET with `?$apply=`.

- **`AGENTS.md`** — project-level rules file for AI agents: no attribution footers
  in commits, documented FileMaker OData unsupported features (lambda `any`/`all`,
  `$search`, geo functions).

### Not implemented (FileMaker limitation)

- **Lambda operators `any` / `all`** — officially unsupported by FileMaker Server
  OData (listed in Claris `odata-unsupported-features.html`, current as of 2026).
  Will not be implemented until Claris adds support.

### Tests

- 22 new unit tests: `buildApplyExpression` (9), `buildCastExpression` (6),
  `buildParameterizedFilter` (10), plus 6 routing/behaviour tests for the new tools.
- Total: 121 tests across 5 suites (up from 90).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-25

Patch release on top of 0.3.0. Version bump and npm publish housekeeping.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 0.3.1 for npm release consistency

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-25

Major stability and correctness release. All changes since 0.2.8 are included here.
FileMaker 2025 advanced OData features (aggregation, type casting, parametrization)
were deferred from this release to keep it focused on reliability; they are
implemented in v0.4.0. Lambda operators (`any`/`all`) remain unsupported by
FileMaker Server OData and are not planned.

### Added

- **`fm_odata_test_connection_detailed`** — new tool that surfaces the real underlying
  error (network, SSL, auth) when a connection attempt fails, replacing opaque failures
  ([#8](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/8))
- **Docker localhost warning** — server prints a clear warning at startup when
  `MCP_HOST=localhost` is detected inside a container, guiding users to use `0.0.0.0`
  ([#10](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/10))

### Fixed

- **OData URL construction** — fixed FileMaker-incompatible URL building that caused
  query failures on certain table/filter combinations
  ([#2](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/pull/2))
- **OData response parser** — corrected response parsing bugs introduced by the above;
  regex metacharacters in table names are now properly escaped
  ([#11](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/11))
- **Tool routing** — tools are now dispatched by exact name-set lookup instead of
  fragile string-prefix matching, preventing mis-routing of similarly named tools
  ([#2](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/2))
- **JSON-RPC response correlation** — concurrent HTTP requests no longer receive each
  other's responses; responses are matched by request `id`
  ([#3](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/3))
- **CORS middleware ordering** — CORS headers are now registered before route handlers,
  fixing preflight (`OPTIONS`) request failures
  ([#6](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/6))
- **SIGTERM / graceful shutdown** — server now handles `SIGTERM` for clean Docker
  container stops; `dumb-init` no longer required to avoid zombie processes
  ([#20](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/20))
- **Failed inline connection cleanup** — a failed `fm_odata_connect` call no longer
  leaves a broken partial connection in state; the real error is reported
  ([#14](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/14))
- **`validateConfig` at startup** — configuration is now validated when the server
  starts, not lazily on first use; misconfigured environments fail fast with a clear
  message ([#15](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/15))
- **Centralised default ports** — default HTTP (3333) and HTTPS (3443) ports now live
  in a single shared constants file, eliminating drift between transport modules
  ([#12](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/12))
- **Runtime version** — server version is now read from `package.json` at runtime
  instead of being hardcoded, so it always matches the published package
  ([#9](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/9))

### Security

- **Password redaction in debug logs** — passwords are scrubbed from tool argument
  objects before they are written to debug output, preventing credential exposure in
  log files ([#22](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/22))

### Refactored

- **Config saved-file schema** — tightened validation schema for
  `~/.fms-odata-mcp/config.json`; added field trimming and a dedicated `verifySsl`
  helper to centralise SSL flag coercion
  ([#16](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/16),
  [#17](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/17),
  [#18](https://github.com/fsans/FMS-ODATA-MCP/issues/18))

### Tests

- Added unit tests for tool routing and config helpers; tightened mock typings
- Removed unused MCP schema imports from `tools/odata.ts`
- Removed unused `Express` import from `simple-http-transport.ts`
